# Manius Market

More of a portfolio project, I don't really expect this to be used in production. That being said, I'm building it as if it could be, and it should be flexible enough to develop so. Anyone can contribute, I'll be updating the list of issues on the project board as I go.

This also doubles as a place for me to learn TurboJS, so the entire website is designed around that.


### What is Manius Market?

This is an online market place, with a focus on markets instead of products like Amazon. This is probably similar to Shopify, but I've never used it so I have no idea what their tools are like, this is simply what I would like to see in a similar app. But this is not a Shopify clone.

It'll have features such as online ordering, inventory management, maybe a basic CMS system, and more. All payment processing will be done through Stripe, and will take full advantage of their API. I doubt that will change, working with PayPal is a pain.
